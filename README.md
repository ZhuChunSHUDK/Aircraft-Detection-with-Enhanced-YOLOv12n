🏗️ Model Architecture
Core Innovations
1. SAC (Switchable Atrous Convolution)

Multi-scale feature extraction using parallel dilated convolutions
Dilation rates: [1, 3, 5] for different receptive fields
Efficient feature fusion with 1×1 convolution

pythonclass SAC(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, atrous_rates=[1, 3, 5]):
        # Parallel branches with different dilation rates
        # Feature fusion and activation
2. TLA (Task-specific Layer Aggregation)

Lightweight attention mechanism optimized for aircraft detection
Channel attention using squeeze-and-excitation principles
Minimal computational overhead

pythonclass TLA(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, c1, c2):
        # Lightweight SE-block style attention
        # Task-specific feature enhancement
Architecture Overview
yamlbackbone:
  - SAC modules for multi-scale feature extraction
  - TLA modules for attention-enhanced features
  - Optimized channel configurations

head:
  - Enhanced feature fusion with TLA
  - Multi-scale detection heads
  - 14-class aircraft detection
